    <p>So you want to help us build this project up? Amazing and thanks in advance! Don't worry, you don't necessarily need to know how to code to help. Here are ways in which you can contribute to this project:</p>
<h3>Submitting Bug Reports</h3><p>Before submitting a bug report please read through the <a href="https://github.com/ladybug-tools/spider-core/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue+label%3Abug+">existing open and closed bug reports</a> to ensure this bug has not been reported or fixed before. If you can't find any report of it there then please try to explicitely describe a reproducible way of arriving at this bug. You can do this by submitting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smallest possible bit of code that leads to this bug</li>
<li>Any error messages</li>
<li>Pictures of cats to make maintainers feel better about the fuss they have cause you </li>
</ul>
<h3>Suggesting Enhancements</h3><p>Before suggesting an enhancement please read through the <a href="https://github.com/ladybug-tools/spider-core/labels/enhancement">existing open and closed feature requests</a> to ensure this bufeatureg has not been proposed before or even already implemented!</p>
<h3>Your First Code Contribution</h3><p>Unsure where to begin contributing to Spider-Core? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ladybug-tools/spider-core/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">Beginner issues</a> - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ladybug-tools/spider-core/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22">Help wanted issues</a> - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do check the local development section of these tutorials in case you haven't really used NodeJS much before or aren't too familiar with Eslint or JSDoc.</p>
<h3>Pull Requests</h3><p>The process described here has several goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain Spider-Core's quality</li>
<li>Fix problems that are important to users</li>
<li>Engage the community in working toward the best possible Spider-Core</li>
<li>Enable a sustainable system for Spider-Core's maintainers to review contributions</li>
</ul>
<p>Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow the <a href="./tutorial-styleguide.html">styleguides</a></li>
<li>After you submit your pull request, verify that all <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/">status checks</a> are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details></li>
</ol>
<p>While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.</p>
