Amazing and thanks in advance! Don't worry, you don't necessarily need to know how to code to help. Here are ways in which you can contribute to this project: Submitting Bug ReportsBefore submitting a bug report please read through the existing open and closed bug reports to ensure this bug has not been reported or fixed before. If you can't find any report of it there then please try to explicitely describe a reproducible way of arriving at this bug. You can do this by submitting: Smallest possible bit of code that leads to this bug Any error messages Pictures of cats to make maintainers feel better about the fuss they have cause you Suggesting EnhancementsBefore suggesting an enhancement please read through the existing open and closed feature requests to ensure this bufeatureg has not been proposed before or even already implemented! Your First Code ContributionUnsure where to begin contributing to Spider-Core? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues: Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two. Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues. Do check the local development section of these tutorials in case you haven't really used NodeJS much before or aren't too familiar with Eslint or JSDoc. Pull RequestsThe process described here has several goals: Maintain Spider-Core's quality Fix problems that are important to users Engage the community in working toward the best possible Spider-Core Enable a sustainable system for Spider-Core's maintainers to review contributions Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers: Follow the styleguides After you submit your pull request, verify that all status checks are passing What if the status checks are failing?If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite. While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.5.5 on 2019-04-03T21:33:34+00:00 using the DocStrap template. "},"tutorial-local-development.html":{"id":"tutorial-local-development.html","title":"Tutorial: Local Development","body":" Documentation Modules gbXMLParserthreeGenerator Tutorials ContributingGetting Started Local Development To start contributing you will need to set up your local coding environment if this is not already the case. Installing NodeJSWe all have to start our coding, Javascript or NodeJS journey somewhere so why not start with Spider-Core! For the sake of ensuring that specific versions of NodeJS may be used without making your life difficult in the future, we recommend installing NodeJS through nvm, which manages multiple NodeJS version on your machine for you. NVM - OSX/Linux NVM - Windows Once nvm is installed, you may open a Windows command shell and start using NodeJS 11 by installing it using the following commands nvm install 11 nvm use 11nvm install 11 nvm use 11Or nvm install latestnvm will report to you the number of the release it has installed. Or even set NodeJS 11 as your default: nvm user default 11Using NPMHere is a great guide on what NPM is and how to use it. The low down is that NPM stands for Node Package Manager and... well... it manages nodejs packages. Installing a code editorThere are many code editors out there and it is pointless to start listing them all. If you're not sure/don't care which to pick, we reccomend you use VSCode because most developers for this project use it and it'll make it easier to setup linting and such. Cloning Spider-CoreIn order to write code and propose changes you will need to Fork the project and clone your Fork to your computer. You will need to install git to do so. Once git is installed run the following command replacing YOURNAME with your github username: git clone git@github.com:YOURNAME/spider-core.gitInstalling Node PackagesOnce the repository has been cloned you will need to install the Node packages so you can run tests and ensure the code is working. First cd into the project folder and then run npm install: cd /path/to/spider-core npm installWriting CodeRight! You're good to go! Write some awesome code, don't forget to test it and check the Contributing docs to make sure you're Pull Request gets dealt with as smoothly as possible.

"},"tutorial-styleguide.html":{"id":"tutorial-styleguide.html","title":"Tutorial: StyleGuide","body":" Documentation Modules gbXMLParserthreeGenerator Tutorials ContributingGetting Started StyleGuide Git Commit MessagesIn order to facilitate code versioning and deployment we use semantic-release. You can read all about it on their Github but essentially versioning is applied automatically based on commit messages. For this reason a specific commit style is required, we follow Angular Commit Message conventions. You could type this all manually OR you could install commitizen. The easiest way to do so is to simply run the command below: npm install -g commitizen cz-conventional-changelog &amp;&amp; echo '{ \"path\": \"cz-conventional-changelog\" }' &gt; ~/.czrcYou should now be able to commit changes and easily follow the angular commit style by running: git czJavaScript StyleguideReadable code is achieved through linting. This is what ESlint is used for. We follow the AirBnB linting style. The easiest way to follow this linting style is to setup Eslint on your code editor or run the following command and check for warnings/errors: npm run lintYou can activate it in VScode by downloading the ESLint package. It should pick up linting issues and help you correct them as you code. And before you ask...
